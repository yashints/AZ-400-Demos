# How To Create a Pull Request on GitHub

## Introduction

Git is an open-source distributed version control system that makes collaborative software projects more manageable. Many projects maintain their files in a Git repository, and platforms like GitHub have made sharing and contributing to code accessible, valuable, and effective.

Open-source projects that are hosted in public repositories benefit from contributions made by the broader developer community through pull requests, which request that a project accept changes you have made to its code repository.

This tutorial will guide you through making a pull request to a Git repository through the command line so that you can contribute to open-source software projects.

## Before the class

Nothing is required before the class for this demo.

## During the class

Open the `run.azurecli` and run the commands. Then navigate to GitHub in a browser and show the result. Feel free to merge the pull request and talk about different merge strategies.
